# Practice 3 - Time Series Pattern Detection with Evolutionary Algorithm

## Instructions for Running the Algorithm

1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main pipeline:  
   `python src/main.py`
3. Output files (plots, features, annotations, metadata) will be saved in the `results/` directory.

### User Options

- You can adjust parameters such as smoothing window, peak detection threshold, and evolutionary algorithm settings by editing the arguments in `main.py`.
